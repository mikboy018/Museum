2 JUL 17 - Time to test/fix android issues. Rolled back to AVPro, and GVR 1.0.3. Now I'm figuring out how to debug,
which seems like subject matter that should've been covered somewhere earlier in the course.
Fixed everything with a fresh start (copying all the maps/scripts/prefabs, of course).

1 JUL 17 - Built the main scene, importing free assets from unity store (Industrial Textures - Arkham Interactive).
Added script to change between levels. Need to implement artifact collection (done), video unlocking (done), and counting (done). Once this
is complete, I will finish gathering videos and add the remaining scenes. Last but not least should be the special feature
I have planned for the Game Industry scene (3E). I did notice one bug... if I re-enter a room, the artifact re-appears.
Slowly re-working throught the logic, I realized it wise to keep all master variables with master logic. I also made it
so that you only have to grab an artifact once. After all of this, I made a copies of the Movies scene, as it made a great
baseline for the rest of the scenes. Now, I just need to add some text.
	
29 JUN 17 - I decided to work on adding the blue key. I wanted it to change height similar to project 3, but also rotate quickly.
After some playing around, I realized a simple transform.rotate and transform.position line was all I needed. Ended up with a pretty
nice animation. I've also fixed the autoplay and pointer control functions for the movie screen prefab. Now, I just need to have it
check to see if the artifact is collected before the player can play.

27 JUN 17 -  I need to be better about updating this file. I've managed to work out Ground Raycasting via the Udacity-supplied
content from Project 4 studies. Next, I plan to gather assets for the other rooms. At this time, I still need to record game video
and locate content for some of the other rooms. I plan to use the key from Project 3 with an animation to rotate it. I also need
to import my homemade script for scores, and determine how to maintain scores between levels. This is a bit out of scope for this 
project, but is useful for future projects. Also, I love the game Accounting, but I just got Rick and Morty VR on sale, and will
be recording screenshots from that, instead. I bet it will be more polished/complete, given its a paid-for game.

23 JUN 17 -
After some trial and error (and of course following instructions), I think I've finally figured out the GitHub Desktop
and Unity issues I was having. Additionally, last night I decided to go with the Occulus VR sdk for video streaming
in this project. I'm also adding the task list for tracking purposes.

22 JUN 17 - 
Having some issues committing all the unity files for backup via GitHub Desktop and Unity with these instructions:
